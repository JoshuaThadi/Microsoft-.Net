    <h1>üî•Microsoft .Net</h1>
  </div> 
<h4>.NET is a free, open-source, cross-platform developer platform created by Microsoft for building many different types of applications. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build</h4>

<h3>‚ú¨ Core Components of .NET</h3>

1] <b>.NET SDK </b>- A software development kit that includes compilers, libraries, and CLI tools.<br>
2] <b>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</b> -	The virtual machine component that handles memory management, type safety, and exception handling.<br>
3] <b>BCL (Base Class Library)</b> - A large collection of pre-built libraries for common functions like file handling, database access, XML manipulation, and more.<br>
4] <b>Languages</b> - C#, F#, and Visual Basic are officially supported.<br>
6] <b>ASP.NET Core</b> - A powerful framework for building web applications and APIs.<br>
7] <b>Entity Framework (EF)</b> - Core	An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for working with databases using .NET objects.<br>
8] <b>MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)</b>	- Used for building cross-platform mobile and desktop apps with a single codebase.<br>
9] <b>Blazor	</b> - Enables building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.<br>
    
<h3>‚ú¨ Types of Applications You Can Build with .NET</h3>
 
1] <b>Web Apps</b> -	ASP.NET Core, Blazor <br>
2] <b>Desktop Apps</b> - Windows Forms, WPF, MAUI <br>
3] <b>Mobile Apps</b>	- .NET MAUI, Xamarin <br>
4] <b>Cloud</b> -	Azure with .NET <br>
5] <b>IoT</b> -	.NET on Raspberry Pi and ARM devices <br>
6] <b>Games</b> -	Unity with C# <br>
7] <b>AI/ML</b> -	ML.NET <br>
    
<h3>‚ú¨ Key Benefits of .NET</h3>
‚úÖ Cross-platform: Build and run apps on Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br>
‚úÖ Language support: Use C#, F#, or VB.NET.<br>
‚úÖ High performance: Especially with ASP.NET Core.<br>
‚úÖ Scalable and flexible: Ideal for microservices and enterprise-level applications.<br>
‚úÖ Active ecosystem: Supported by Microsoft and a large open-source community.<br>

3] <b>Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</b> ‚Äì For building Windows desktop applications with rich UI. <br>
4] <b>Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</b> ‚Äì Framework for building service-oriented applications. <br>
5] <b>ML.NET</b> ‚Äì Machine learning framework for .NET developers. <br>
6] <b>ADO.NET</b> ‚Äì Data access technology for interacting with databases. <br>

<h3>‚ú¨ Testing & Quality Assurance Tools</h3>

1] <b>xUnit.net</b> ‚Äì Popular unit testing framework for .NET applications. <br>
2] <b>NDepend</b> ‚Äì Static analysis tool for measuring code quality and dependencies. <br>
3] <b>dotnet test</b> ‚Äì Command-line tool for running tests in .NET projects. <br>
